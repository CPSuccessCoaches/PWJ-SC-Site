After trying many different things I finally found a strategy to follow. Following this strategy made me 'Job ready' in 7 months. Building a great routine and using some techniques really helped me to be able to learn next to a fulltime-job. I'm now working at one of the greatest companies i've ever seen in Germany. Also very much interested in personal development, fitness and stuff like this. Favourite Book: Can't Hurt me - David Goggings; Technologies: React, React Native, Node.js",
